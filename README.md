# Tom
My progress on building a humanoid, Tom. In order to achieve such a lofty aspiration, I begin this progress by building a network that bridges a machine's language to our language. This is done by exploring the realms of Natural-language processing methods where Tom exploits the use of the latent space of the pre-trained models like Roberta.
